<h4>Overlap View</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Under this variant, when user moves the courser to the focused cell, the cell will enlarge and overlap the surrounding cells
  to create focused view and expose the value mentioned in that cell to the user. This variant is the easiest and simplest
  as per users point of view. This is user friendly as user can directly have required information without any distractions.</p>
<p class="text-justify">This variant avoids any kind of base distortion. Because as per paper [1] We identified popular distortion techniques and
  the type of visualizations those distortions can be applied to and formalize why deception occurs with those distortions.</p>
