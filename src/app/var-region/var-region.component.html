  Its still a challenge for developers to manage millions of records in a single data base with making it most
  user-friendly display. All the above-mentioned vari- ants are making visualization of user better related to focused
  value. And also providing neighborhood context to the user for better results of their require- ments. But all the
  above-mentioned variants does not include large datasets into one table
</p>
<p class="text-justify p-1">
  What if we need a requirement to make each cells size to pixel for display the whole table in single page. This
  technique will be utilized in this variant. This variant will make user select a specific region, where he/she wants
  to focus on and then select the visualization looks which are mentioned in the above variants.
